//I copied code over from random squares.
//I suppose I could just rearange the squares to line atop each other to make the cross
//swith the horizontal verticle. 
//thisis challenging, I have subsidized many intergers in toder to move
//thelines individually, after talking to eliess, the right way
//seems to be to draw lines. 
//I have abandond making crosses with squares and have mobed tolines, Lisa 
//says mos to the class did it this way. I have basically used the
//same code for the squares, replacing lines. I should run into difficulties
//with the lay over. The numbers are not lining up for the cross. 
//if i adjust numerical values within the line, I can achieve the cross. 
//after some time, I talked to jake and he reccomends I add a x interger into my equasion
//by adding the verti na dmultiplying it by intergier i, I believe i can get a 
//repeated square for 1/2 of the line.
