//I wasnt sure where in this txt the variables stood for arrays. 
//I was testing the interger statements at first. but ill be honest ~i barely made progress for an hour and a half
//I sought help at the hybrid lab, and recieved it from dena. 
//she explained that replacing the ellipse with a line to track could make the animation
//appear to draw a straigt line without lag. she also showed me that the coordinates must increase by one
//I want th be very clear. i still dont fully undderstand arrays,and will not 
//claim this code as my own. I asked for help in the hybrid lab and 
//dena gave me the answer with an explanation of how to solve the probklem. 
//if we coukld go over this again in class, I would really appriicate the help.
